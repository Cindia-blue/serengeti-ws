Every trigger expression is parsed, and if the trigger condition is met, the list of actions provided in the trigger expression is executed.</p><p>Each trigger has all of the following fields:</p><ul><li><span class='code'>triggerName</span> <strong>(mandatory)</strong> - the name of the trigger. This value must be unique for the specific service. </li><li><span class='code'>triggerExpression</span> <strong>(mandatory)</strong> - a tsquery expression representing the trigger. <li><span class='code'>streamThreshold</span> <strong>(optional)</strong> - the maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned will cause the condition to fire. <li><span class='code'>enabled</span> <strong> (optional)</strong> - by default set to 'true'. If set to 'false' the trigger will not be evaluated.</p><p>For example, here is a JSON formatted trigger that fires if there are more than 10 DataNodes with more than 500 file-descriptors opened:</p><p><pre>[{\"triggerName\": \"sample-trigger\",\n  \"triggerExpression\": \"IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleType = DataNode and last(fd_open) > 500) DO health:red\",\n  \"streamThreshold\": 10, \"enabled\": \"true\"}]</pre></p><p>Consult the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.</p><p>The JSON format is evolving and may change in the future and as a result backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases at this time.</p>",
