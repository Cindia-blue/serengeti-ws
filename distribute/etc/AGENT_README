serengeti-agent.sh is a script to configure serengeti server automatically.
It includes server initialization and re-configuration.

serengeti-firstboot.rb is used to initialize the serengeti server.
It configures rabbitmq first. It creates a virtual host named /chef.
Then it creates a (non-administrative) user named chef with (initial) 
password testing. It also grants the user named chef access to 
the virtual host called /chef, with configure permissions on all 
resources for any name, and write and read permissions on all resources.

Second, get vsphere properties (user defined in vApp properties) when booting up by vmware-rpctool.

Afterwards, configure knife during first bootup. For knife configuration, it sets
the permissions for ${SERENGETI_HOME}/.chef first, changing the folder permission
to serengeti:serengeti. Back up ${SERENGETI_HOME}/.chef/knife.rb as it will 
generate new knife.rb when config knife. Then it copies validation.pem and webui.pem 
from /etc/chef/ to ${SERENGETI_HOME}/.chef. serengeti-knife-config is an expect script
to run "knife configure -i". It will be executed in first bootup. Then it replaces the
generated knife.rb using the former knife.rb.

Then it will handle the user-input vc properties, such as vc username, vc password,
init Hadoop Resource settings(it cannot be re-configured), network port group, DHCP 
or static network, ip, netmask, gateway, dns if users use static network.

Afterwards update network according to the related properties.

Later, update chef_server_url in ${SERENGETI_HOME}/.chef/knife.rb using the real ip address.

Package cli tool into a shell script, and set ${SERENGETI_HOME}/sbin to system path.

Acquire the serengeti server's resource pool, datastore, datacenter, vcenter information and
serengeti template id by talking vc using vc ip, vc username and vc password.

Then, update distro_root, vc_addr, vc_user, vc_pwd, vc_datacenter, template_id in
${SERENGETI_HOME}/conf/serengeti.properties using the related value.

Restart tomcat to make sure that the settings take effect.

Run "serengeti connect --host localhost:8080" command line to initialize the connection.

At last, check the initial Hadoop resource settings flag, if true, it adds the resource pool,
datastore, network portgroup information using command line.

Now, the serengeti server initialization is finished, please enjoy the serengeti journey.

serengeti-subsequesntboot.rb handles the re-configuration for reboot. You can re-configure all parameter
except init Hadoop Resource settings. But the reconfiguration will take effect after reboot.

For re-configuration, it configures rabbitmq as before first, and then gets vsphere properities. Later,
update and reconfigure network. Acquire the user-input properties. Then update chef_server_url in 
${SERENGETI_HOME}/.chef/knife.rb using the real ip address. Later, get vc information by talking to vc.
Update ${SERENGETI_HOME}/conf/serengeti.properties using the corresponding value. Restart tomcat.
Serengeti reconfiguration completes.
